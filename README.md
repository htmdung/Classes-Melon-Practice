# Classes-Melon-Practice
We’ll take a real world set of objects, data, and behaviors and create several classes that could encapsulate these objects in a Python program. We’ll also create one relationship between two classes.
The Melon Farm
In this exercise, we’ll take a real world set of objects, data, and behaviors and create several classes that could encapsulate these objects in a Python program. We’ll also create one relationship between two classes.

The scenario:

At a nearby melon farm, a large melon harvest is imminent. The farm grows several types of melons. The farm expects to harvest many melons each day.

In this object-based system, we’ll have two objects:

MelonType

Melon
